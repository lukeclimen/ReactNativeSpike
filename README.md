# React Native Spike

This spike was created by following the crash course provided by Brad Traversy on his youtube channel.

## Shopping List App

This spike creates a shopping list app for an android phone. The shopping list is simplistic but incorporates some of the more commonly used react native components:

- View
- Text
- StyleSheet
- FlatList
- TouchableOpacity
- TextInput
- Alert

The spike also uses functional components and some state that is passed between the App.jsx, where it lives to the components that are manipulating it.
